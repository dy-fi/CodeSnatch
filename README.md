## Running Locally
Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dy-fi/CodeSnatch

npm install
nodemon app.js
```
The app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). Make sure MongoDB is installed and MongoDB Daemon is running.
